                <h2>I'M LISSETTE VALLE</h2>
                <p>Like many, I have been down many walks of life. I studied biochemistry in college with gave me my fix for the insatiable curiosity I've always had for finding the 
                    truth of why things exist. I then went on to work in a clinical lab where I was drowned in data and the mundane. Though I knew this was not my calling I knew 
                    there was something to be said about the way data curates understanding when examined a certain way. That spark stimulated my interest in technology. 
                    I then essentially gave up everything and deep dove full time into a full stack java development bootcamp. All the information and avenues of creation that unfolded
                    before me was much more than what I could have ever imagined. I loved it all, from the creativity and expression on building something aesthetically functional and
                    beautiful on the front end, to being the architect on the back end. I built my first full stack web application about something else I am truly passionate about, yoga,
                    and never looked back. I am now in pursuit to help others by applying my passions in making their web applications dreams come true.</p>

                <p>My professional experience started in science. I studied biochemistry in college which then led me to work in a clinial lab for a few years. As much as I love science I desired a field with more opportunity to grow on a day to day basis. Something that integrated my insatiable passion for art and the utlization of my analytical mind. I worked a lot with technology in he lab which led me to start taking on computer science on the side. I realized how endless the field was so I started working on little projects on my own. I took a complete professional pivot and decided to take on a software development bootcamp full time. There I attended 450+ hours of hand on coding experience with Java, Javascript, CSS, and SQL. I learned about agile methodologies and how to successfully deploy various projects utilizing SDLC. The hours were long and workload unforgiving if not tackled 100%. That leap of faith off as I was able to achieve valedictorian of my class. That validation reassured me that I was on the right path. Since then I have launched my personal portfolio using json and wordpress. My proudest feat was producing an application for yoga instructors implementing CRUD methodologies for yoga instructors to create yoga sequences. I hope to continuously expand my experience in the software development world, help others, and never stop learning along the way.  </p>
